# Matrix Calculator

This calculator was written to simplify exporting matrices to DocX format. The app properly formats the matrices 
as math objects inside the word document, with a brief description of each operation you perform on the matrix. There is also
an option to automatically reduce a matrix and log all the steps to the word document.
